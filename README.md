# node-tf2-schema

Get information about TF2 items, effects, skins and more

Modernized by Brom127 to use Typescript, Classes and async/await Promises.

Includes Typescript types for the Schema and items (except items_game, for now).

Attempts to maintain compatibility with the original node-tf2-schema. The logic and most methods remain the same, though callbacks have entirely been replaced with Promises.
